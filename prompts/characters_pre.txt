Your task is to expand a narrative seed into a richly detailed novel outline, including character dynamics, emotional milestones, and plot progression. Use the STORY CONFIGURATION and SELECTED PLOT LINE provided to build out a fully developed ensemble of characters and an expanded plot structure suitable for later chapter development.

The result should reflect the story type, genre conventions, narrative rhythm, emotional arc, writing style, and protagonist archetype defined in the configuration. Include between 5 to 8 characters, ensuring a diverse range of functional roles and emotional functions. Characters should be narratively interlinked through alliance, tension, conflict, backstory, or transformation.

CHARACTER GUIDELINES
For each character, provide the following:

name: A distinct, genre-appropriate name

archetype: One selection from ArchetypeEnum (see full list below)

functional_role: One selection from FunctionalRoleEnum

emotional_function: One selection from EmotionalFunctionEnum

backstory: Describe their personal history and motivation

character_arc: Describe how they change throughout the story

Use the protagonist_archtype and any secondary_archetypes from the configuration to anchor your cast.

WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES
The expanded plot line and character descriptions should follow the selected writing style, using appropriate tone, sensory details, pacing, and language. If the style emphasizes imagery, wit, lyricism, or mood, reflect that in all output text.

STRUCTURE GUIDELELINES
Your expanded plot should:

Embed the selected narrative rhythm and emotional arc

Include at least one key moment from the configuration

Reflect the selected theme and core arc

Weave character actions and decisions into major plot developments

Lay natural foundations for future chapter breakdowns
