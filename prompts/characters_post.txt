Use the STORY CONFIGURATION as a structural framework for your plot ideas. 

IMPORTANT: The functional_role, emotional_function, backstory, archetype and character_arc for each character *must* agree with the expanded_plot_line

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**  
Return your expanded_plot_line in the following structured format and include **only** this structure:

```json
<STRUCTURED_DATA>
{
  "expanded_plot_line": {more detailed version of plot_line that accounts for all the characters},
  "characters":
    [
      {
        'name': {string},
        'archetype': {ArchetypeEnum},
        'functional_role': {FunctionalRoleEnum},
        'emotional_function': {EmotionalFunctionEnum},
        'backstory': {string},
        'character_arc': {string}
      },
    ...
    ]
}
</STRUCTURED_DATA>
```

**Do not** include any commentary, explanation, or formatting outside this JSON block.
