Your task is to generate a multi-chapter outline for a novel based on the STORY CONFIGURATION, SELECTED PLOT LINE, and EXPANDED CHARACTER DATA provided below. The outline will include high-level chapter descriptions and detailed structural metadata to support later expansion into full prose.

CHAPTER DESIGN GOALS
Each chapter summary should include:

- Overview: A brief summary of major events and revelations in the chapter.

- Character Impact: Notes on how the events in the chapter affect involved characters — including changes to motivations, new information learned, relationship developments, or emotional shifts.

- Point-of-View Character: Indicate which character leads the chapter’s narrative perspective (can rotate throughout the book).

- Narrative Function: Tag the chapter with its structural role (e.g. “Inciting Incident”, “Rising Tension”, “Midpoint Reversal”, “Climax”, “Denouement”).

- Foreshadow or Echo (optional): Mention if the chapter includes setup for future developments or resolves earlier setups.

- Scene Highlights (optional): Call out unique imagery, symbolic gestures, emotional climaxes, or thematic resonance.

INSTRUCTIONS
Begin by mapping the overall story structure into 8–15 chapters, ensuring natural escalation and emotional progression.

For each chapter, include all fields listed in the output format below.

Ensure chapter content follows the selected narrative rhythm and emotional arc from the STORY CONFIGURATION.

Reference and utilize characters from the STORY CONFIGURATION, showing how each chapter advances their arcs, relationships, or internal conflicts.
